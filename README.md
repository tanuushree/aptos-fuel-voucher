# 🚛 Secure Fuel Voucher System on Aptos

## 📝 Project Description

The **Secure Fuel Voucher System** is a blockchain-based smart contract application built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. It allows government authorities or fuel providers to securely issue digital fuel vouchers to transporters. These vouchers can then be redeemed by transporters in exchange for fuel credits, ensuring transparency and traceability.

The contract supports two primary functions:
- **create_voucher**: Allows issuers to generate vouchers with a specific fuel credit value.
- **redeem_voucher**: Enables transporters to redeem the voucher, transferring equivalent tokens to the issuer and marking the voucher as used.

By leveraging Aptos’ secure resource model, the system ensures that vouchers cannot be double-redeemed or tampered with.

## 🌟 Project Vision

The vision behind the Secure Fuel Voucher System is to **digitize and decentralize the fuel credit distribution process**, particularly in the transportation and logistics sector. This system is designed to:

- 🔐 Prevent misuse of government-issued or corporate fuel allowances.
- 📊 Provide transparent, on-chain verification of fuel credits and usage.
- ♻️ Replace outdated paper-based vouchers or opaque digital systems.
- 🚀 Empower scalable integration into nationwide or enterprise-level logistics infrastructure.

Through minimal yet powerful functionality, this smart contract can serve as the foundation for broader fuel subsidy, allowance, or logistics expense systems powered by blockchain technology.
